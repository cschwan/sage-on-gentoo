sage 10.8 has fully switched to meson as its building system.
This build system does not currently support the modularisation that happened
in the last few years, with the exception of sagemath-giac.
The best way to migrate will be to unistall sage and any optional sagemath-* 
packages first before installing the new sagemath package.
If you have used the sets, you can achieve that with
emerge -C @sagemath @sagemath-optional
emerge sagemath

The sets will not be useful going forward but will be kept around until the
release of sage following 10.8 to help with any migration.

For people without the sets the following packages are to be removed if
installed:
sci-mathematics/sage_setup
sci-mathematics/sagemath-standard
sci-mathematics/sage_docbuild
sci-mathematics/sage-doc
sci-mathematics/sage-conf
sci-mathematics/sagemath-bliss
sci-mathematics/sagemath-meataxe
sci-mathematics/sagemath-sirocco
sci-mathematics/sagemath-tdlib

Followed by 
emerge sagemath

to install sage-10.8. The new documentation package is called 
sagemath-doc for consistency and will be automatically pulled if you have
the doc useflag enabled (default).

Note that the building of the pdf documentation is currently not working 
and not made available.

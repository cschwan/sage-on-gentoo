sage 10.8 is switching to meson as its building system.
This build system does not currently support the modularisation that happened in
the last few years, with the exception of sagemath-giac.
Whe sage-10.8 is released, the best way to migrate will be to unistall sage and
any optional sagemath-* packages first before installing the new sagemath
package.
If you have used the sets, you can achieve that with
emerge -C @sagemath @sagemath-optional
emerge sagemath

As of sage-10.8.beta2, the switch has been completed, so users of 
*-9999 ebuilds which pulls those betas should switch to the already available
sagemath ebuild.
Note that the building of the documentation is currently not working and shoud
be turned off.

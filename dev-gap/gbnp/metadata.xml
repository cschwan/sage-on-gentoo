		The GBNP package provides algorithms for computing Grobner
		bases of noncommutative polynomials with coefficients from
		a field implemented in GAP and with respect to the 
		"total degree first then lexicographical" ordering. Further
		provided are some variations, such as a weighted and truncated
		version and a tracing facility. The word "algorithm" is to be
		interpreted loosely here: in general one cannot expect such an
		algorithm to terminate, as it would imply solvability of the
		word problem for finitely presented (semi)groups.

		This package, previously known as CrystGAP, provides a rich set of methods for the computation with 
		affine crystallographic groups, in particular space groups. Affine crystallographic groups are fully 
		supported both in representations acting from the right or from the left, the latter one being 
		preferred by crystallographers. Functions to determine representatives of all space group types of 
		a given dimension are also provided.

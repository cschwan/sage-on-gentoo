		The package tkz-graph.sty is a set of convenient macros for drawing
		graphs. The kind of graphs that I will present, are sometimes called
		combinatorial graphs to distinguish them from the graphs of functions.
		The package tkz-graph.sty is built on top of PGF and its associated
		front-end, TikZ and is a (La)TeX-friendly drawing package. The aim is
		to provide a high-level user interface to build graphs relatively
		simply.

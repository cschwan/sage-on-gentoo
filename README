sage-on-gentoo provides (experimental !) split ebuilds for the computer algebra
system SAGE (www.sagemath.org).

Documenation for Sage's eclass can be found in the Documentation/ subdirectory.
Other documentation resides on the wiki-pages.

or fork sage-on-gentoo and do it yourself!

QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE:

1. GET LAYMAN:
   The preferred method of getting this repository is now layman. Make sure you
   have it installed and correctly configured. You can find a guide here:

     http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml.

2. ADD REPOSITORY:
   Update your layman list and add this repository with:

     layman -L
     layman -a sage-on-gentoo

3. UNMASK AND USE-FLAG PACKAGES:
   Before installing, you will need to unmask the required packages. A list of
   all required packages is located at:

     sage-on-gentoo/packages.keywords/sage

   Permanent unmasking can be done easily via placing a symbolic link in your
   /etc/portage/package.keywords directory, e.g.:

     ln -s /usr/local/portage/layman/sage-on-gentoo/package.keywords/sage \
           /etc/portage/package.keywords/sage

   Since the Sage ebuild requires its dependencies to be built with several USE-
   flags it is also a good idea to use the provided package.use file:

     ln -s /usr/local/portage/layman/sage-on-gentoo/package.use/sage \
           /etc/portage/package.use/sage

4. TEST THE EBUILD:
   Type

     emerge -va sage

   to install sage; note that sci-libs/blas-atlas will take its time (on my pc
   about 4 hours). If you intend to test sage I _strongly recommend_ to use
   ccache (FEATURES=ccache, dev-util/ccache) which speeds up subsequent
   compilations.

5. UPDATE REPOSITORY:
   To update simply type:

     layman -S

   and reemerge sage with

     emerge sage

   to use the latest ebuild (if you add additional options to emerge make sure
   that sage will get recompiled!).

INSTALLATION GUIDE AND SOME NOTES:

1. GET LAYMAN:
   The preferred way of getting sage-on-gentoo is layman. Make sure layman is
   installed and correctly configured. You may find a guide for layman here:

     http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml

2. ADD OVERLAY:
   Update your layman list and add this overlay with:

     layman -L
     layman -a sage-on-gentoo

3. UNMASK AND USE-FLAG PACKAGES:
   Before the installation you will need to unmask the required ebuilds. You
   should use the following file which already contains all required entries:

     sage-on-gentoo/packages.keywords/sage

   For permanent unmasking place a symbolic link to this file into your
   /etc/portage/package.keywords/ directory:

     ln -s <path-to-layman>/sage-on-gentoo/package.keywords/sage \
           /etc/portage/package.keywords/sage

   Since the Sage ebuild requires its dependencies to be built with several USE-
   flags we provide a standard package.use file:

     ln -s <path-to-layman>/sage-on-gentoo/package.use/sage \
           /etc/portage/package.use/sage

   <path-to-layman> is usually /usr/local/portage/layman, for layman 1.3.0 and
   higher it is /var/lib/layman.

4. INSTALL SAGE:
   Type

     emerge -va sage

   to install sage; note that this will pull in a lot of dependencies. You will
   also notice that sci-libs/blas-atlas will take a lot of time to compile (3 to
   4 hours).

5. UPDATE OVERLAY:
   To update your local copy of sage-on-gentoo simply type:

     layman -S

   After that you may run

     emerge -vuDNa world

   or a similar command to check for updates.

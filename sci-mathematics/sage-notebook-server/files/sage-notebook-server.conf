# boolean (default: False) if True use https so all communication, e.g.,
# logins and passwords, between web browsers and the Sage notebook is
# encrypted via GNU TLS. Highly recommended!

# automatically logged in as user admin
require_login="True"

# boolean (default: False) if True, any visitor to the website will be able

# integer (default: 0) seconds until idle worksheet sessions automatically
# timeout, i.e., the corresponding Sage session terminates. 0 means "never

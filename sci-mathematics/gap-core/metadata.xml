		Groups, Algorithms, Programming is a system for computational
		discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on Computational Group
		Theory. GAP provides a  programming language, a library of thousands
		of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP
		language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. GAP
		is used in research and teaching for studying groups and their
		representations, rings, vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial
		structures, and more.
		This ebuild provide core functionality.

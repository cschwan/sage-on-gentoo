    """
    This class defines the exception that should be raised when a
    function, method, or class cannot detect a Sage package that it
    depends on.

    This exception should be raised with a single argument, namely
    the name of the package.

    When an ``PackageNotFoundError`` is raised, this means one of the
    following:

    - The required optional package is not installed.

    - The required optional package is installed, but the relevant
      interface to that package is unable to detect the package.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.misc.package import PackageNotFoundError
        sage: raise PackageNotFoundError("my_package")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        PackageNotFoundError: the package 'my_package' was not found. It may or may not be available in portage

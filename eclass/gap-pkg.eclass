# @FUNCTION: gap-pkg_path
# @USAGE:
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Return the path into which the gap package should be installed.
# The legacy location is usr/share/gap/pkg and the accepted current location is
# usr/$(get_libdir)/gap/pkg

# @USAGE:
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Return the folder holding the file sysinfo.gap for gap-4.12.0 and later

	echo "${ESYSROOT}/usr/$(get_libdir)/gap"

# @FUNCTION: gap-pkg_gaparch
# @USAGE:
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Return the variable GAParch from sysinfo.gap

# @VARIABLE: GAP_PKG_OBJS
# @REQUIRED
# @DESCRIPTION:
# List directories to be installed (recursively) and list of other objects to be installed apart from .g objects in S.

# @VARIABLE: GAP_PKG_EXE
# @REQUIRED
# @DESCRIPTION:
# List of gap executables to be installed and that are not already in bin/$GAParch.

# @FUNCTION: gap-pkg_src_install
# @USAGE:
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Perform some of the standard install of src_install and then perform specific gap package installation steps.
# Create the package directory and install all .g file in ${S} and all objects in GAP_PKG_OBJS
# Inside the package directory, create the folder bin/$GAParch and install any executables found inside
# bin/$GAParch inside $S. Install any other objects listed in GAP_PKG_EXE in that folder.
# From the standard src_install, we do not run "make install" as most makefiles distributed with gap packages
# lack one. It only leads to errors. If a package does have a genuine "make install" step, it needs to be run separately
# and then gap-pkg_src_install needs to be called explicitely.

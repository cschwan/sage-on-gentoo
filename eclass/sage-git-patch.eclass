# @BLURB: Pull and apply PR from the sage repo as patch
# @DESCRIPTION:
# To avoid patch duplication with upstream, especially for supporting
# newer packages, it is useful to directly use git PR as patch.
# This eclass as a generic fetcher to add PR to SRC_URI and a special
# patch preparation process, as sage upstream PR patch are not directly
# applicable to produced sdist. This is because sdists have one less
# level depth compared to the git tree.
